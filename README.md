#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/lf4bS5IKqLo
#### Description: This final project for Harvard CS50x is a full-stack website using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python (Flask), and SQLite. This is a blog where I can post my pictures and an explanations for each of them about my life in Japan. There is a session functionality so anyone can register. The password is hashed in the database. It is not possible to create an account with an existing username. Then the users can login and see all the posts ranked by most recent. My account is Admin so I can add new posts via another link in the nav bar. There is a function to add a picture, one to add title, and one to add content. Then I click the Post button and the data is saved in the database and rendered in the homepage.
